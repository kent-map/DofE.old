The Dane John Gardens, at the heart of Canterbury, are beautiful in any season. Enjoy a stroll through the park and admire the sundial by Weekes, the fountain where you can throw in pennies for the Lady Mayoress's charity, the bandstand, and the war memorial.  With formal flower beds and an avenue of trees and with the city walls acting as a boundary on one side, the gardens are nestled underneath the Dane John mound and close to the bus station.
